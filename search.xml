    <content type="text"><![CDATA[#Everyday RC——Ecoefficiency Ecoefficiency (measures to minimize environmental impact through thereduction or elimination of waste from production processes) has becomea goal for companies worldwide, with many realizing significant costsavings from such innovations. Peter Senge and Goran Carstedt see thisdevelopment as laudable but suggest that simply adopting ecoefficiencyinnovations could actually worsen environmental stresses in the future.Such innovations reduce production waste but do not alter the number ofproducts manufactured nor the waste generated from their use anddiscard; indeed, most companies invest in ecoefficiency improvements inorder to increase profits and growth. Moreover, there is no guaranteethat increased economic growth from ecoefficiency will come in similarlyecoefficient ways, since in today’s global markets, greater profits maybe turned into investment capital that could easily be reinvested inold-style eco-inefficient industries. Even a vastly more ecoefficientindustrial system could, were it to grow much larger, generate moretotal waste and destroy more habitat and species than would a smaller,less ecoefficient economy. Senge and Carstedt argue that to preserve theglobal environment and sustain economic growth, businesses must developa new systemic approach that reduces total material use and totalaccumulated waste. Focusing exclusively on ecoefficiency, which offers acompelling business case according to established thinking, maydistract companies from pursuing radically different products andbusiness models.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The first day using my blog Micro-diary —terrible but wonderful at last Although some people claim that it only takes almost 5 minites to set up a unique blog, for me, almost 2 hour to complete this simplified blog. English is really important when lots of techniques and methods in English needed to be understood. In the future,I need to study the markdown style and some knowedge about github. Important, be familiar with cmd, oders. Do not be stupid!!!]]></content>
