    <url>%2F2019%2F03%2F21%2FExam-Writing%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Exam Writing 1 About MotivationThe topic “The level of pay is the most significant factor in influencing employee motivation.” Discuss. You must refer to Input text 1 and Input text 2 and you can use your own observations. Write at least 500 words. My essayIntroduction There is not doubt that better motivation could lead to higher work efficiency. However, the most effective approach to provide incentives is controversial. Some experts claim that salary is the most significant motivation source for all the employees. This essay will argue that although money can meet the fundamentally physical need, it is still not the most vital incentives for staff of individual differences and tremendous impacts pf intrinsic rewards. best —- the most effective is —- meet the need staff(uncountable) BP1 It has been argued that economic incentives as a form of extrinsic rewards has a dominant influence on staff’ efficiency. According to the theorist F.W. Taylor’s experiment in steel factory, the total steel yield was 3 times than before when bonuses were not given to those hard-working employees (Input text 1). It seems that the rational- economic concept of motivation is appropriate. However, Herzberg’s two factor theory disagrees with this point. He suggests that people will not work harder if they have enough money(Input text 1). For some other high-skilled employees, normal economic reward could not satisfy the demands and they always prefer other intrinsic rewards. BP2 Intrinsic motivation play a significant role in employees’ work efficiency. There are many kinds of intrinsic rewards which give workers self-esteem and happiness of helping others. For example, 12.7 million people in England volunteered once a month(Input text2). It is obvious that their purpose is not pay and they enjoy this process by being aware of their value and meaning. The happiness of helping others also can stimulate workers’ abilities. The study held by Time magazine demonstrates that students who know their calling is really helpful to people have more enthusiastic , leading to nearly 2 times profits than before(Input text 2). Happiness and self-appreciation are gained in this work experience, which encourages them to be more willing to work, even though they do not get much money. BP3 Individual differences should be noticed when considering the most effective motivation for employees, no matter intrinsic rewards or extrinsic rewards. Money is merely a physiological need, which is at the bottom of the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs(Input text 1). There are many other higher levels in this hierarchy, which is suitable to used to explain different status of employees’ motivation prefer. For example, the significant difference between workers in factory and designers in Apple is that those workers need to follow specific rules strictly in case of being discharged. However, for designers in Apple, instead of concerning regulations and salaries, they prefer to chase esteem and self- actualization(Input text 1). Therefore, different status of employees may have different objectives, resulting in various motivation source. Conclusion Money indeed has strong effects on employees’ motivation, particularly for those some low- paid or unskilled employees. However, the argument that salary is the most important factor can not perfectly applied to all the employees since there are individual differences and important effects of other intrinsic rewards. The most efficient method to provide best motivation for single employee is to consider intrinsic and extrinsic rewards at the same time, noticing individual differences. Problems Lack of cohesion among sentences and paragraphs. lack of roadmap—-no clear sub-points Not academic enough complicate sentences without clear meaning Improvement Cohesion : link with smooth transitions: Aside from, In additional, Moreover adversative relation : However, while, Even though, It is true that This sample thesis statement : Even though the level of pay is the prime motivation factor. Social needs and sense of achievement are more effective tools of motivation. PS : Concession + own stands with two aspects of analyzation(out and in) Sample essay Introduction Give a definition about the main topic show the purpose and importance of this topic different opinions main thesis statement clear roadmap BP1 “It can be claimed that” to show the counter argument Basic structure of citing theory generalization+ specific examples + implication specific examples + general theory 1 + general theory 2 BP2 “Even though” show the turning trend Theory generalization+ specific examples + implication Linking : “This was evident in” , “This is evidence of” BP3 In addition Theory generalization+ specific examples + implication linking: “This means”, “This negativity would contribute to”,”this demonstrate that” Conclusion Concession + main argument General reasons some authorities agree two sub-points]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[The book thief movie review]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F03%2F20%2Fthief%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The book thief movie review This film is adapted from the 2005 young-adult bestseller by Australian writer Markus Zusak. The leading character is —Liesel, a young girl in 1930s Germany who is left to kindly but harassed foster parents Hans and Rosa by her fugitive Communist mother. The brutal reality of the Holocaust is not dwelt upon. It is this trio’s courage and victimhood that take center-stage.** Liesel is forced to join the Hitler Youth, but is secretly disgusted by the Nazis’ book-burning displays and conceives a love of literature by “borrowing” books from the Mayor’s wife. And as war breaks out, she is taught to love writing by Max, the Jew that her foster parents are hiding in the cellar, and whose deferential friendship and gratitude are the guarantee of their good-Germanness. It is true that this lite-historical tosh has absolutely nothing in common with the power of Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List. It’s a worryingly lenient and obtuse approach to history and historical evil, which are smothered in feelgood tragi-sentimental slush. “The Book Thief” has its moments of brilliance, thanks in large part to an adept cast. But the movie about a girl adopted by a German couple during World War II also crystallizes the perils of book adaptations. Based on a bestselling novel, the movie tries heartily to contain writer Markus Zusak’s myriad plot points, but the result is a rushed conclusion, which tempers the intended tear-jerking climax. The sticky-fingered title character is Liesel. With bouncy blond hair and big, sad eyes, actress Sophie Nélisse utterly embodies the character of a girl given up for adoption shortly after her brother dies. When Liesel’s on-the-run Communist mother can no longer care for her, she’s taken in by Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson). The child immediately bonds with her new father, a smiling accordion player who calls Liesel “your majesty.” Rosa is more standoffish and looks constantly for excuses to yell. (She finds many.) Despite her tendency to pick up lost books, Liesel can’t read or write, and that momentarily makes her a punch line at school. One bully learns quickly, though, that although Liesel can’t spell, she can fight, and that’s just the first hint of her tenacious personality. After Hans teaches her to read, Liesel’s world begins to expand, both through stories from books she sneakily “borrows” and in a reality that’s informed by an oppressive regime. In this small German village, she finds reasons to be optimistic thanks to a friendship with another youngster, Rudy (Nico Liersch), but she also comes to understand the saddest repercussion of Third Reich rule after a man named Max comes to the family’s door one night. The son of Hans’s old friend, Max is Jewish and on the run, and he ends up hiding in the family’s basement. There is plenty here to create both an emotional payoff and a healthy dose of suspense. But director Brian Percival’s film squanders the opportunities by squeezing a number of other subplots into the two-hour run time. These threads have the space to breathe and evolve in a novel, but when it comes to the film, less would have been more. That being said, “The Book Thief” has its pleasures. Along with a memorable performance from Nélisse, Rush and Watson prove their impressive range. Despite the film’s dark themes, there are a number of scenes of gentle comedy, and those come mostly thanks to Rush’s and Watson’s facial expressions and delivery. Ben Schnetzer, who plays Max, hasn’t acted in many films, but his performance is indelible as an older brother figure trying to protect his young friend from the sad realities of the day. From the pristinely shot scenes of a train chugging through a snowy landscape that open the film, “The Book Thief” has a sleekness to it. That feeling is mirrored in a plot that feels whitewashed in some ways. For example, Rosa discusses cutting back on meals now that the family has to provide for its refu­gee, but there aren’t depictions of hunger or suffering. Just as Max tempers the reality for Liesel, the movie does the same for its viewers. That ensures a PG-13 rating and a broader audience, of course. But when the delivery is blunted, the audience’s emotions will tend to follow suit. ​ The brown Chocolate color is the death’s favorite.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[#Everyday RC——Ecoefficiency Ecoefficiency (measures to minimize environmental impact through thereduction or elimination of waste from production processes) has becomea goal for companies worldwide, with many realizing significant costsavings from such innovations. Peter Senge and Goran Carstedt see thisdevelopment as laudable but suggest that simply adopting ecoefficiencyinnovations could actually worsen environmental stresses in the future.Such innovations reduce production waste but do not alter the number ofproducts manufactured nor the waste generated from their use anddiscard; indeed, most companies invest in ecoefficiency improvements inorder to increase profits and growth. Moreover, there is no guaranteethat increased economic growth from ecoefficiency will come in similarlyecoefficient ways, since in today’s global markets, greater profits maybe turned into investment capital that could easily be reinvested inold-style eco-inefficient industries. Even a vastly more ecoefficientindustrial system could, were it to grow much larger, generate moretotal waste and destroy more habitat and species than would a smaller,less ecoefficient economy. Senge and Carstedt argue that to preserve theglobal environment and sustain economic growth, businesses must developa new systemic approach that reduces total material use and totalaccumulated waste.
