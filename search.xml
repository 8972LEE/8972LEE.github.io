    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Exam Writing 1 About MotivationThe topic “The level of pay is the most significant factor in influencing employee motivation.” Discuss. You must refer to Input text 1 and Input text 2 and you can use your own observations. Write at least 500 words. My essayIntroduction There is not doubt that better motivation could lead to higher work efficiency. However, the most effective approach to provide incentives is controversial. Some experts claim that salary is the most significant motivation source for all the employees. This essay will argue that although money can meet the fundamentally physical need, it is still not the most vital incentives for staff of individual differences and tremendous impacts pf intrinsic rewards. best —- the most effective is —- meet the need staff(uncountable) BP1 It has been argued that economic incentives as a form of extrinsic rewards has a dominant influence on staff’ efficiency. According to the theorist F.W. Taylor’s experiment in steel factory, the total steel yield was 3 times than before when bonuses were not given to those hard-working employees (Input text 1). It seems that the rational- economic concept of motivation is appropriate. However, Herzberg’s two factor theory disagrees with this point. He suggests that people will not work harder if they have enough money(Input text 1). For some other high-skilled employees, normal economic reward could not satisfy the demands and they always prefer other intrinsic rewards. BP2 Intrinsic motivation play a significant role in employees’ work efficiency. There are many kinds of intrinsic rewards which give workers self-esteem and happiness of helping others. For example, 12.7 million people in England volunteered once a month(Input text2). It is obvious that their purpose is not pay and they enjoy this process by being aware of their value and meaning. The happiness of helping others also can stimulate workers’ abilities. The study held by Time magazine demonstrates that students who know their calling is really helpful to people have more enthusiastic , leading to nearly 2 times profits than before(Input text 2). Happiness and self-appreciation are gained in this work experience, which encourages them to be more willing to work, even though they do not get much money. BP3 Individual differences should be noticed when considering the most effective motivation for employees, no matter intrinsic rewards or extrinsic rewards. Money is merely a physiological need, which is at the bottom of the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs(Input text 1). There are many other higher levels in this hierarchy, which is suitable to used to explain different status of employees’ motivation prefer. For example, the significant difference between workers in factory and designers in Apple is that those workers need to follow specific rules strictly in case of being discharged. However, for designers in Apple, instead of concerning regulations and salaries, they prefer to chase esteem and self- actualization(Input text 1). Therefore, different status of employees may have different objectives, resulting in various motivation source. Conclusion Money indeed has strong effects on employees’ motivation, particularly for those some low- paid or unskilled employees. However, the argument that salary is the most important factor can not perfectly applied to all the employees since there are individual differences and important effects of other intrinsic rewards. The most efficient method to provide best motivation for single employee is to consider intrinsic and extrinsic rewards at the same time, noticing individual differences. Problems Lack of cohesion among sentences and paragraphs. lack of roadmap—-no clear sub-points Not academic enough complicate sentences without clear meaning Improvement Cohesion : link with smooth transitions: Aside from, In additional, Moreover adversative relation : However, while, Even though, It is true that This sample thesis statement : Even though the level of pay is the prime motivation factor. Social needs and sense of achievement are more effective tools of motivation. PS : Concession + own stands with two aspects of analyzation(out and in) Sample essay Introduction Give a definition about the main topic show the purpose and importance of this topic different opinions main thesis statement clear roadmap BP1 “It can be claimed that” to show the counter argument Basic structure of citing theory generalization+ specific examples + implication specific examples + general theory 1 + general theory 2 BP2 “Even though” show the turning trend Theory generalization+ specific examples + implication Linking : “This was evident in” , “This is evidence of” BP3 In addition Theory generalization+ specific examples + implication linking: “This means”, “This negativity would contribute to”,”this demonstrate that” Conclusion Concession + main argument General reasons some authorities agree two sub-points]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Silence of the lambsThe original ending **In the original ending, Lecter is cutting orange segments with a small paring knife, while he speaks to Clarice. As he hangs up the phone, the camera shot widens. We discover that he is at a desk in a book lined office. There is the body of a bodyguard on the floor, and then we see Lecter is not alone. Chilton is trussed up in a chair across from him, the same method of restraints the doctor used on Lecter earlier in the movie. Lecter rises, slowly, a dreamy gleam in his eye, as he approaches his terrified victim, paring knife in hand. “Shall we begin?” **]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[#Everyday RC——Ecoefficiency Ecoefficiency (measures to minimize environmental impact through thereduction or elimination of waste from production processes) has becomea goal for companies worldwide, with many realizing significant costsavings from such innovations. Peter Senge and Goran Carstedt see thisdevelopment as laudable but suggest that simply adopting ecoefficiencyinnovations could actually worsen environmental stresses in the future.Such innovations reduce production waste but do not alter the number ofproducts manufactured nor the waste generated from their use anddiscard; indeed, most companies invest in ecoefficiency improvements inorder to increase profits and growth. Moreover, there is no guaranteethat increased economic growth from ecoefficiency will come in similarlyecoefficient ways, since in today’s global markets, greater profits maybe turned into investment capital that could easily be reinvested inold-style eco-inefficient industries. Even a vastly more ecoefficientindustrial system could, were it to grow much larger, generate moretotal waste and destroy more habitat and species than would a smaller,less ecoefficient economy. Senge and Carstedt argue that to preserve theglobal environment and sustain economic growth, businesses must developa new systemic approach that reduces total material use and totalaccumulated waste. Focusing exclusively on ecoefficiency, which offers acompelling business case according to established thinking, maydistract companies from pursuing radically different products andbusiness models.

English is really important when lots of techniques and methods in English needed to be understood. In the future,I need to study the markdown style and some knowedge about github.
