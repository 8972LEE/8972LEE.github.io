    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The first day using my blog Micro-diary â€”terrible but wonderful at last Although some people claim that it only takes almost 5 minites to set up a unique blog, for me, almost 2 hour to complete this simplified blog.

Important, be familiar with cmd, oders. Do not be stupid!!!]]></content>
